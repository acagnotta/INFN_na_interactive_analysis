    "    Setup connection to a Dask cluster. Two ingredients are needed:\n",
    "    1. Creating a cluster object that represents computing resources. This can be\n",
    "       done in various ways depending on the type of resources at disposal. To use\n",
    "       only the local machine (e.g. your laptop), a `LocalCluster` object can be\n",
    "       used. This step can be skipped if you have access to an existing Dask\n",
    "       cluster; in that case, the cluster administrator should provide you with a\n",
    "       URL to connect to the cluster in step 2. More options for cluster creation\n",
    "       can be found in the Dask docs at\n",
    "       http://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/api.html#cluster .\n",
    "    2. Creating a Dask client object that connects to the cluster. This accepts\n",
    "       directly the object previously created. In case the cluster was setup\n",
    "       externally, you need to provide an endpoint URL to the client, e.g.\n",
    "       'https://myscheduler.domain:8786'.\n",
    " \n",
    "    Through Dask, you can connect to various types of cluster resources. For\n",
    "    example, you can connect together a set of machines through SSH and use them\n",
    "    to run your computations. This is done through the `SSHCluster` class. For\n",
    "    example:\n",
    " \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from dask.distributed import SSHCluster\n",
    "    cluster = SSHCluster(\n",
    "        # A list with machine host names, the first name will be used as\n",
    "        # scheduler, following names will become workers.\n",
    "        hosts=[\"machine1\",\"machine2\",\"machine3\"],\n",
    "        # A dictionary of options for each worker node, here we set the number\n",
    "        # of cores to be used on each node.\n",
    "        worker_options={\"nprocs\":4,},\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    ```\n",
    " \n",
    "    Another common usecase is interfacing Dask to a batch system like HTCondor or\n",
    "    Slurm. A separate package called dask-jobqueue (https://jobqueue.dask.org)\n",
    "    extends the available Dask cluster classes to enable running Dask computations\n",
    "    as batch jobs. In this case, the cluster object usually receives the parameters\n",
    "    that would be written in the job description file. For example:\n",
    " \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from dask_jobqueue import HTCondorCluster\n",
    "    cluster = HTCondorCluster(\n",
    "        cores=1,\n",
    "        memory='2000MB',\n",
    "        disk='1000MB',\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    # Use the scale method to send as many jobs as needed\n",
    "    cluster.scale(4)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    " \n",
    "    In this tutorial, a cluster object is created for the local machine, using\n",
    "    multiprocessing (processes=True) on 4 workers (n_workers=4) each using only\n",
    "    1 core (threads_per_worker=1).\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    cluster = LocalCluster(n_workers=4, threads_per_worker=1, processes=True)\n",
    "    client = Client(cluster)\n",
